			<td>Avengers: Age of Ultron, this movie was directed by Joss Whedon. The Avengers, consisting of Iron Man, Black Widow, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Hawkeye, are against Ultron, who is a robot originally designed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.</td>
			<td>I liked this movie because of the scenes it was able to show. The emotions of each character was shown very well. Even though, Ultron is a robot, he was able to show malice and cruelty as if he was also a human. I would give this movie an 8/10.</td>

			<td>Avengers:Infinity War, this movie was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. The Avengers, now with Black Panther and the Guardians of the Galaxy, are against Thanos, a strong warlord who wants to cut the entire population of the universe in half, believing that it is beneficient to all, and does this by obtaining the infinity stones.</td>
			<td>This move is one of the best movies I have ever watched solely because the scenes are well directed and the actors did a great job, but this movie also ended in a cliffhanger which made it better. I would rate this movie a 9.5/10.</td>

			<td>Avengers:Endgame, was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. After Thanos accomplished his goal, the Avengers are left with only half of their team. After 5 years, Scott Lang returns from the quantum realm and tells everyone that there is a way to reverse what Thanos did.</td>
			<td>This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched because the pacing was good and did not feel rushed, the actors did an amazing job and I got to see all my favorite characters fight against one of the greatest villains.</td>
