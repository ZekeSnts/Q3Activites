	<p>The series revolves around the adventures of protagonists Finn the Human (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a teenage human boy, and his best friend Jake the Dog (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, and travel the land while they adventure. Along the way, they interact with the other main characters of the show: Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), and Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson).

				<p>It is revealed in "Min and Marty" that Finn was born on Hub Island (one of the human-inhabited islands outside of The Land of Ooo) to his father Martin Mertens and his mother, Minerva Campbell. Having been a known con artist, Martin is confronted by an old foe and forced to flee the house with baby Finn while Minerva was at work. Martin brings Finn onto a raft, only to be attacked by the Guardian. Finn and Martin are separated as a result, with Finn being sent adrift towards Ooo and Martin disappearing.

Jake was 28 years old at his debut in "magical dog years," and ages throughout the series, though he rarely acts mature.</p>
